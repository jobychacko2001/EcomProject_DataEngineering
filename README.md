## Project Overview

This project is focused on designing and implementing data pipelines using dbt Core to aggregate and store key metrics for an e-commerce platform. The goal is to enable efficient analysis and reporting across several critical areas:

Search Effectiveness: Track and evaluate the effectiveness of search functionalities, helping to optimize user experience and search result relevance.
Product Performance: Aggregate sales and customer interaction data to assess the performance of individual products, identifying trends and opportunities for growth.
Campaign Outcomes: Analyze the success of marketing campaigns, measuring impact on sales, customer acquisition, and overall ROI.
Inventory Management: Monitor inventory levels, stock turnover, and supply chain efficiency to ensure optimal stock levels and minimize costs.
By leveraging dbt, this project aims to provide a scalable and maintainable data infrastructure that supports data-driven decision-making across the organization.
